    * Including option to keep items in type of store, or completely randomized
* Randomization of Chest Items and Key Items

    * Early Airship Access can be implemented at this point, however implications of it are yet to be explored.

## Planned Features
* Keyword Randomization
* Boss randomization (including adjusting stats based on where and when they are encountered)

    * Static Step Counter Table to be randomized each seed possibly?
* Various bug fixes
